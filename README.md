# random-quote-generator

A random quote generator built with vanilla Javascript for my TeamTreehouse Techdegree Unit 1
project.

## What does it do?

It displays famouse quotes and shows the source. some quotes also have citation and year. 

I also added a couple extra features to the app which were not required but optional challenges. 

<ul>
  <li>Auto refresh of the quote at a set interval</li>
</ul>
