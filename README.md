# random-quote-generator

A random quote generator built with vanilla Javascript for my TeamTreehouse Techdegree Unit 1
project with an emphases on Javascript.

## What does it do?

It displays famous quotes and shows the source. some quotes also have citations and year.

I also added a couple extra features to the app which were not required but optional challenges.

<ul>
  <li>Auto refresh of the quote at a set interval</li>
  <li>Random background color generator on each new quote</li>
</ul>

## Languages & Frameworks

This random quote generator was build using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
